# Whether Weather

In-progress weather tool that renders an image for a home screen widget.

## Dev Flow

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python poc.py
echo "http://$(ifconfig | rg 'inet (192\S*)' -r '$1' -o):8000/black_circle.png"
python -m http.server
```

Then see [widget docs](docs/widgets.md) for how to use the image in a widget.
